Tanner Verber
As a programmer, I want to detect the word size of an image file so that we know what format we are working with
  Weeks: 1
  Confirmation: Written code that correctly outputs the size of the image (.png) file
As a greedy steganographer, I want to select how many bits our algorithm changes during the steganography, so that we can hide larger files
  Weeks: 1
  Confirmation: Written code that changes the amount of bits altered by the algorithm
As a photographer, I want to input multiple types of image files and have them converted to .png files if necessary
  Weeks: 2
  Confirmation: Code that converts different types of image files to .png without changing or losing data
What I will do for next class: Become familiar with Javascript

As a developer, I want to check if my file sizes are able to support steganography and return an error message otherwise.
So that steganography doesn't occcur when it's impossible.
  Weeks: 1
As a non-tech-save user, I want to see the maximum file size I can store in a given image with a given greediness.
So that I can select an appropriate file.
  Weeks: 1
As a paranoid person, I want to check that the steganography worked via a color picker to compare before and after photos.
So that I can see the change in the image.
