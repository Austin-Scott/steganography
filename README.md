 ## Nicholas LaBelle
 * As a Steganographer I want a simple and elagant interface to select my image and hidden file so that I don't accidentally select the wrong files.
   * Weeks: 2
 * As a Mobile User, I want to be able to use the steganography app via a phone
   * Weeks: 2


 ## Connor Fergesen
 * As a Stegnographer, I want to hide a .txt file inside an image, 
so that the secrets inside the .txt file don't get read by the wrong people.
   * Weeks: 2
   * Confirmation: Give a .txt file to the program you want to be hidden. The program will display the before and after image.
 * As a Steganographer, I want to retrieve a .txt file from an image so that I can read it.
   * Weeks: 2
   * Confirmation: Give an image that has gone through steganography with a .txt file to our program. The program will find the data hidden in the image and display to the user what it finds.


 ## Evan Vander Hoeven
 * As a programmer I can have a repository to share my code so that we can collaborate as a team. 
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: The existance of this repository is confirmation of this task.
 * As an internet connected person, I want to connect to the app via the internet to secure my data so that I can staganographize from any place.
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: A computer without the repository as local files can access the application in its web browser.
 * As a programmer, I want my code to be readable so that others can read our source code
   * Weeks: 2
   * Confirmation: All of the source code in this repository have an appropriate amount of comments, every function has doxygen documentation, and all files have appropriate headers. 

# Evan's Log
* (11-27-2018)
 * What did I do? I created a repository and ensured that everyone in the group had access to the repository.
  * What will I do? I will be looking into ways to host the website for free.
  * Is anything blocking me? My github pages is already in use for another website, so I will need for alternate places to host, or to manipulate github pages to meet the needs of the application.
  * What do I believe is the percent chance that we will complete the sprint? 65%

 ## Tanner Verber
 * As a programmer, I want to detect the word size of an image file so that we know what format we are working with
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: Written code that correctly outputs the size of the image (.png) file
 * As a greedy steganographer, I want to select how many bits our algorithm changes during the steganography, so that we can hide larger files
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: Written code that changes the amount of bits altered by the algorithm
 * As a photographer, I want to input multiple types of image files and have them converted to .png files if necessary
   * Weeks: 2
   * Confirmation: Code that converts different types of image files to .png without changing or losing data


 ## Brendan Bard
 * As a developer, I want to check if my file sizes are able to support steganography and return an error message otherwise.
   * Confirmation: So that steganography doesn't occcur when it's impossible.
   * Weeks: 1
 * As a non-tech-save user, I want to see the maximum file size I can store in a given image with a given greediness.
   * Confirmation: So that I can select an appropriate file.
   * Weeks: 1
 * As a paranoid person, I want to check that the steganography worked via a color picker to compare before and after photos.
   * Confirmation: So that I can see the change in the image.
   * Weeks: 2
  
  
 ## Austin Scott
 * As a programmer, I want a fixed length header to guide my file discovery algorithm so that we stop decrypting at the end of the hidden file.
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: Given an image with a file hidden in it, as well as a greed level, there will be a function that will determine the hidden file's type (text/image) and the size (length/shape).
 * As a developer, I want an optimized algorithm so that our program runs faster and uses less memory. 
   * Confirmation: The four algorithms written to find and hide data inside images won't take any uneccessary steps and they will use only the memory that they need to.
   * Weeks: 2
 * As a programmer, I want a Javascript Pseudocode layout of our algorithm. This should give me an idea of the structure that my team and I will need to follow when we implement our core hide/find functions.
   * Confirmation: JavaScript functions that demonstrate the basic functionality of hiding and finding hidden data inside PNG images.
   * Weeks: 1
